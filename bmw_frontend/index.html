        <h2>First podium for Spengler in the 2018 DTM season.</h2>
        <p>In the 15th race of the 2018 DTM season, BMW Team RBM’s Bruno Spengler achieved his first podium finish of the season at the Nürburgring. After 40 laps, the Canadian driver crossed the finishing line second in the BMW Bank M4 DTM. Three more BMW drivers followed Spengler into the top-ten.</p>

        <p >Victory went to Audi driver René Rast, while Timo Glock put on a successful charging performance in the DEUTSCHE POST BMW M4 DTM to move up from twelfth place and cross the line in fourth. Right behind him, BMW Team RMG driver Marco Wittmann drove the BMW Driving Experience M4 DTM to fifth place. Wittmann’s team-mate Augusto Farfus (Shell BMW M4 DTM) finished ninth, scoring two points. Joel Eriksson (BMW M4 DTM) and Philipp Eng (SAMSUNG BMW M4 DTM) finished in twelfth and 16th positions.</p>

        <p >Before the 100th race for BMW since the DTM comeback in 2012 gets going on Sunday, the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife will be the focus of attention in the morning. BMW works driver Martin Tomczyk, working as a race expert for German TV channel SAT.1, will then be racing through the “Green Hell” with the BMW M4 DTM race taxi.</p>

        <h2>Marco Wittmann in the home race for the BMW Team RMG.</h2>

        <p>In BMW Team RMG’s home race at the Nürburgring, Marco Wittmann finished third to reach the podium in the BMW Driving Experience M4 DTM. After completing 40 laps, he was just 3.439 seconds behind the winner, René Rast (Audi). Wittmann now has 137 points and is the best-placed BMW driver in the overall standings, in fifth place. The BMW drivers once again gave a strong team performance with five BMW M4 DTMs making it into the top ten, scoring a total of 45 points.</p>

        <p>Behind Wittmann, Bruno Spengler (BMW Bank M4 DTM) secured fourth place. Joel Eriksson (BMW M4 DTM), Augusto Farfus (Shell BMW M4 DTM) and Philipp Eng (SAMSUNG BMW M4 DTM) followed in sixth, seventh and eighth positions. Timo Glock had to be content with 16th place after an early collision and subsequent drive-through penalty. As was the case on Saturday, BMW Team RBM claimed the fastest pit stop with Eriksson’s car.</p>

        <p>BMW Motorsport, BMW Team RBM and BMW Team RMG were competing in their 100th DTM race since BMW’s comeback in 2012. Farfus and Spengler have been involved in every one of those 100 races.</p>

        <h1>BMW Team RLL heads to Laguna Seca with a lot of momentum.</h1>

        <h3>The Californian circuit has been a good hunting ground for BMW Team RLL in the past.</h3>

        <p>Following the first BMW M8 GTE victory and a third place at the previous round at Virginia International Raceway, BMW Team RLL heads to this weekend’s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round at Laguna Seca Raceway with a lot of momentum. Team Principal Bobby Rahal and his squad aim to extend the success streak on the iconic Californian circuit within sight of Monterey Bay</p>
