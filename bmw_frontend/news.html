                        <h3>BMW CUSTOMER RACING: HIGHLIGHTS OF THE WEEKEND</h3>
                        <h4>Rink, Brink and Leisen claim the title!</h4>
                        <p>BMW Hat-trick in the VLN: Christopher Rink, Danny Brink and Phillipp Leisen have secured
                            overall victory in the VLN Endurance Championship Nürburgring with the Pixum Team Adrenalin
                            Motorsport #490 BMW 325i. This means that a BMW car has topped the overall standings for the
                            third consecutive time, as the winner from the last two seasons had driven a BMW M235i
                            Racing. It marks the 16th title for BMW. The trio rounded off a great season, securing the
                            V4 class victory in the final race of the season at the Nordschleife. “I can still hardly
                            believe what we have achieved,” said Rink after the race had finished. Brink added: “that's
                            a huge relief, especially after everything that happened after the eighth race.” The BMW
                            325i had been disqualified due to a technical protest after the eighth race. The team
                            lodged an appeal against this decision and the DMSB appeal court then found in their favour.
                            “We were under a lot of pressure and we are delighted that we have finally been able to
                            claim the title,” said Leisen.</p>

                        <p>It was not just the VLN overall standings that gave Pixum Team Adrenalin Motorsport reason

                            they recorded a sixth win of the season in the #650 BMW M235i Racing. Their closest
                            competitor, Tristan Viidas, finished second in Securtal Sorg Rennsport’s #694 BMW M235i
                            Racing and secured this final placing in the championship as well. The Estonian driver

                        <h3>INTERNATIONAL GT OPEN</h3>
                        <h4>Season finale in Barcelona</h4>
                        <p>The International GT Open season drew to a close this weekend at Barcelona. Four BMW M6 GT3s
                            were in action. It was an especially exciting time for Fran Rueda and Andrés Saravia in the
                            #47 BMW M6 GT3 of Teo Martín Motorsport, as the duo’s performances throughout the season
                            meant that they still had a good chance of claiming the title. After finishing eighth in
                            Saturday's race, Rueda/Saravia secured pole position on Sunday and then finished fourth.
                            That was not quite enough to overhaul their competitors in the title race and they had to
                            be content with second place overall. Their team-mates endured some bad luck in the final
                            race; Lourenço Beirão da Veiga and Juan Cruz Álvarez in the #3 BMW M6 GT3 had to retire
                            early, as did Marcio Basso and Guilherme Salas in the #7 car. Beirão da Veiga/Álvarez had
                            secured tenth place on Saturday, while Basso/Salas crossed the line in second place in the
                            Am standings. BMW Motorsport Junior Mikkel Jensen and regular driver Richard Gonda put on
                            an impressive performance at the wheel of the fourth BMW M6 GT3. The duo claimed fourth and
                            fifth places for the Senkyr Motorsport team.</p>
